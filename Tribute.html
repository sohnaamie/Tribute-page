        <div class="about-him">
            <p>Distinguished historian and Pan-Africanist political leader, Cheikh Anta Diop was born in Diourbel, Senegal on <strong> December 23, 1933</strong> to a Muslim
                Wolof family. He argued that the origins of civilization and human development trace back to Africa, particularly ancient Egypt. He challenged the widespread belief that African cultures were inferior by showcasing how African people were the true pioneers of science, mathematics, and culture. Diop’s work emphasized that the foundation of human progress and civilization started in Africa, and he sought to correct historical misconceptions by highlighting Africa’s central role in shaping the world.</p>
